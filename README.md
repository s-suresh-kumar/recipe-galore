## Description

This app helps the user to auto generate a professional looking README.md. It interactively asks the user pertinent questions about the app, such as title, description, installation instructions, usage instructions, license information, how to contribute and collaborate to make the app a better product and collects user e-mail and github username so that any questions can be sent to the author ( user).

## Installation

You need inquirer package installed for this app to run. So the steps are :

1. Clone this [repository](https://github.com/s-suresh-kumar/readmeGenerator)
2. Issue `npm i` at your local repository root, so that all dependencies (inquirer package) is installed.
3. Then launch node index.js and answer all questions properly.
4. Your README.md will get auto-generated.

## Instructions

Since this is a command line app, just run 'node index.js'. The app will ask series of questions, once you answer all of them the app will automatically generate a professional looking README.md.
